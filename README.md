Project zero for Revature

I've had many issue with this project. I thought by watching the recordings and using Google, I could get the project to work but I was inccorect.
The version on this repo was an attempt to start fresh and write the java code from scratch, but I failed.

I feel a bit defeated for failing this much with my first ever project, but I'm not discouraged. I really love writing code and I really, really want to learn Java. I feel defeated from failing, but I am even more motivated to leadrn, overcome, and suceed.
